# DrCareProject

## Project Overview

Doctor Care is a comprehensive medical application designed for patient follow-up and diagnosis assistance. It provides several key features aimed at improving healthcare management:

- **Chatbot Assistance**: Interact with a chatbot to discuss symptoms, obtain information on specific diseases, and upload medical images (chest X-rays, heartbeats, skin cancer scans, brain tumors, and retinal OCTs) to receive automated diagnoses.
- **Doctor Interaction**: Schedule appointments with doctors, communicate with them directly, and upload posts about your health issues for professional feedback.
- **Alarm and Notification Management**: Set alarms to remind patients to take their medication, aiding in treating chronic conditions such as diabetes and heart disease.
- **Location Services**: Locate nearby hospitals and healthcare providers for quick emergency access.
- **IoT Integration**: Monitor close individuals with irregular health conditions (e.g., oxygen levels, heart rate, temperature) using devices connected to the app for real-time updates.

The application leverages **IoT technology** to connect medical devices and communicate real-time health data seamlessly without human intervention.
